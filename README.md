# ColorDetection
Color Detection using OpenCV and Pandas

This code is a color detection program that uses OpenCV and Pandas libraries. It takes an image as input and allows the user to double-click on any point in the image to detect the color at that point. The detected color is then displayed on the image along with its corresponding color name. The color name is retrieved from a CSV file that contains a list of colors with their RGB values and names. The program continues to run until the user presses the 'Esc' key, at which point it terminates.
